It is common in American Sign Language ( ASL ) to use space to make compari- sons . Two things under discussion are often `` set up '' spatially . The signer places one item to the left and the other item tothe right . The signer compares the left item with the right item . Let us look at an example to give you an idea : Two different systems , one old and one new . In this example two systems are under discussion , an old one and a new one . The author placed the old system to the left , and the new system to the right .

Classifiers tend to use handshapes that look like the objects or people they portray . They often refer to groups or items that have roughly the same shape . For example , the same classifier used for people , can also be used for things that are long and thin , such as a pencil or a pole that is standing up . All these items look long and narrow . Another classifier is used for things that are round and fat , such as coins or buttons . English does not have classifiers . Many other signed languages have something similar , but use different handshapes . More about classifiers will be discussed in future issues .
