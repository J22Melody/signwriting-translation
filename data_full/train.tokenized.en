Classifiers tend to use handshapes that look like the objects or people they portray . They often refer to groups or items that have roughly the same shape . For example , the same classifier used for people , can also be used for things that are long and thin , such as a pencil or a pole that is standing up . All these items look long and narrow . Another classifier is used for things that are round and fat , such as coins or buttons . English does not have classifiers . Many other signed languages have something similar , but use different handshapes . More about classifiers will be discussed in future issues .
