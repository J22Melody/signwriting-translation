Other countries such as France, Germany, Italy, Japan, China, Korea, <br />and Australia all use their own sign language. In fact, American Sign <br />Language and British Sign Language are nothing alike. In all <br />actuality, ASL historically comes from the sign language of France. <br />Now, because SignWriting is based on movements, that means that any <br />of these sign languages can be written which I like better. Now, I am <br />really glad that I can write directly from my native language. And if <br />there comes a time when what I have written needs to be translated <br />into English, then it can easily be done so. The task of writing can <br />be solely focused on without having to think about how to translate <br />something because that disconnects the thought patterns.

For they don't understand God's way of making people right with himself. Refusing to accept God's way, they cling to their own way of getting right with God by trying to keep the law.

It is common in American Sign Language (ASL) to use space to make compari- \nsons. Two things under discussion are often "set up" spatially. The signer places \none item to the left and the other item tothe right. The signer compares the left \nitem with the right item. \n\nLet us look at an example to give you an idea: \nTwo different systems, one old and one new. \nIn this example two systems are under discussion, an old one and a new one. \nThe author placed the old system to the left, and the new system to the right.

Show me the sea, and everything our God created. I'll show you a Man, with love in His hands; it is so much greater. You are the Savior, faithful Redeemer, no greater love, no greater love. I am a sinner, rescued forever, no greater love, no greater love than Yours.\n\nwritten by Evan Wickham
Pr 7:19 For the goodman [is] not at home, he is gone a long journey:\n\nFor my husband gone not home, travel far.

I am waiting in a silent prayer, I am frightened by the Lord I bear. In a world that's cold as stone, must I walk this path alone? Be with me now, be with me now.

Resumo: Este artigo apresenta uma proposta de adaptação do Ensino Baseado em Tarefas (EBT) para o ensino do sistema de escrita de sinais Sign Writing (SW) para adultos sinalizantes. A metodologia seguida é de pesquisa participante, na qual o pesquisador empenhou conhecimento teórico válido para o desenvolvimento de uma proposta de resolução do problema de como adaptar o EBT para o ensino de SW. Baseado nas premissas de Willis (1996) e Ellis (2006) desenvolveu-se Unidades Didáticas para o ensino de SW, o processo de criação é descrito neste trabalho que também analisa o produto gerado. Conclui que é possível adaptar abordagens de ensino de língua estrangeira para lecionar SW, e acredita-se que o trabalho estimule novas investigações em torno das metodologias de ensino para este sistema de escrita das línguas de sinais.\nPalavras-chave: Libras. Sign Writing. Ensino Baseado em Tarefas.

Mt 6:25  Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?\n\nSo I say, if you think future do, what me eat, what me drink, what me clothes. But life not only  clothes, not only food, life not only drink. Do not think about those three. Life mean more.

But if [it be] of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.\n\nAnd if salvation that through His grace, then salvation that not through your effort.

American Sign Language (ASL) uses facial expressions to convey grammatical information.  For example, a YES-NO question is marked with one kind of facial expression; a WHO or WHAT type of question is marked with a different expression.  YES-NO questions are marked by raised eyebrows and the head tilting forward.  How is this written.  We write a circle for a head, we write the eyebrows up with a doublelines, and we place an arrow above the head, representing the forward tilt:

Chapter 14. It was now two days before Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The leading priests and the teachers of religious law were still looking for an opportunity to capture Jesus secretly and kill him.
Verse 19. For they heard an awesome trumpet blast and a voice so terrible that they begged God to stop speaking.
Verse 35. Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you out to preach the Good News and you did not have money, a traveler's bag, or an extra pair of sandals, did you need anything?" "No," they replied.

Hello. My name is Adam Frost. I have been deaf since birth. I use sign <br />language everyday of my life. I have learned English. It is my second <br />language. My greatest frustration growing up was trying to take my <br />thoughts, which were in sign, and having to write them in English. I <br />never liked that feeling of frustration. Later when I found SignWriting, <br />which is a system based on handshapes and movements, not based <br />on any sound what so ever, I found that I was able to express my <br />ideas in sign freely without constraint on paper. I didn't have to <br />struggle with translating my thoughts into English just so that I <br />could write them on paper. So, some people think that sign language <br />is a universal language, but that is not true. I use American Sign <br />Language which is only used across the United States and Canada.

There was a theater festival which included many interesting plays and skits from various countries.\n\nAnd there was an art show, featuring works by deaf artists\n\nAll who attended the conference met a lot of old friends, many of whom they hadn't seen in a long, long time. It was a little like a class reunion\n\nMany participants also made friends from foreign lands, and learned about Deaf cultures and signs in other places around the world. It was a great learning experience\n\nNo one who attended the Deaf way will ever forget it. Those who were not able to attend definitely missed an experience of a lifetime!
Pr 17:5  Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: [and] he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.\n\nIf anyone persecute poor people that same insult his Make agent and if person happy because other person have trouble, God will punish he.

Classifiers tend to use handshapes that look like the objects or people they portray.  They often refer to groups or items that have roughly the same shape.  For example, the same classifier used for people, can also be used for things that are long and thin, such as a pencil or a pole that is standing up.  All these items look long and narrow.  Another classifier is used for things that are round and fat, such as coins or buttons.  English does not have classifiers.  Many other signed languages have something similar, but use different handshapes.  More about classifiers will be discussed in future issues.

American Sign Language uses facial expressions to convey grammatical information.  Conditionals are sentences used to describe things that might or might not happen.  Conditionals can be marked with signs such as IF or SUPPOSE, or they may use just a facial expression.  Scott Lidell, a linguist,  observed that conditionals may involve 3 elements.
