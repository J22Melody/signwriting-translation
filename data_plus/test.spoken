Here in the United States, around the turn of the century, Deaf people had problems because they felt hearing people suppressed the Deaf rights.  This created tension.  So, Deaf people met in secret to discuss what to do.  How could they protect Deaf rights.  They decided to found the National Association of the Deaf(the NAD).  The purpose of the NAD is to demand from the government new laws protecting the Deaf people all over the US, and to establish Deaf access to better education and public services.

Verse 2. This truth gives them confidence that they have eternal life, which God -- who does not lie -- promised them before the world began.
2Co 9:7 Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, [so let him give]; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.\n\nEvery person should in heart decide amount money for give.  Do not give because feel force or because require, but give because enjoy give. God love that attitude.

Verse 9. The things my people do are as depraved as what they did in Gibeah long ago. God will not forget. He will surely punish them for their sins.
