Classifiers tend to use handshapes that look like the objects or people they portray.  They often refer to groups or items that have roughly the same shape.  For example, the same classifier used for people, can also be used for things that are long and thin, such as a pencil or a pole that is standing up.  All these items look long and narrow.  Another classifier is used for things that are round and fat, such as coins or buttons.  English does not have classifiers.  Many other signed languages have something similar, but use different handshapes.  More about classifiers will be discussed in future issues.

Hello. My name is Adam Frost. I have been deaf since birth. I use sign <br />language everyday of my life. I have learned English. It is my second <br />language. My greatest frustration growing up was trying to take my <br />thoughts, which were in sign, and having to write them in English. I <br />never liked that feeling of frustration. Later when I found SignWriting, <br />which is a system based on handshapes and movements, not based <br />on any sound what so ever, I found that I was able to express my <br />ideas in sign freely without constraint on paper. I didn't have to <br />struggle with translating my thoughts into English just so that I <br />could write them on paper. So, some people think that sign language <br />is a universal language, but that is not true. I use American Sign <br />Language which is only used across the United States and Canada.
