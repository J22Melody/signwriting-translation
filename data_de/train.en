Classifiers tend to use handshapes that look like the objects or people they portray.  They often refer to groups or items that have roughly the same shape.  For example, the same classifier used for people, can also be used for things that are long and thin, such as a pencil or a pole that is standing up.  All these items look long and narrow.  Another classifier is used for things that are round and fat, such as coins or buttons.  English does not have classifiers.  Many other signed languages have something similar, but use different handshapes.  More about classifiers will be discussed in future issues.
